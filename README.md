## Platform-Specific Dependencies

This project uses several native dependencies that require platform-specific binaries:

- `@rollup/rollup`: Used by Vite for bundling
- `@swc/core`: Used for fast JavaScript/TypeScript compilation
- `lightningcss`: Used for CSS processing
- `@tailwindcss/oxide`: Used by Tailwind CSS

The project is configured to automatically install the correct binaries for your platform (Windows, macOS, or Linux) through:

1. Optional dependencies in package.json
2. A postinstall script that checks and installs any missing platform-specific dependencies
3. Configuration in .npmrc to handle platform-specific binaries

If you encounter any issues with native dependencies, you can manually install them:

```bash
# For Windows
npm install @rollup/rollup-win32-x64-msvc @swc/core-win32-x64-msvc lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc @tailwindcss/oxide-win32-x64-msvc

# For macOS (Intel)
npm install @rollup/rollup-darwin-x64 @swc/core-darwin-x64 lightningcss-darwin-x64 @tailwindcss/oxide-darwin-x64

# For macOS (Apple Silicon)
npm install @rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64 @swc/core-darwin-arm64 lightningcss-darwin-arm64 @tailwindcss/oxide-darwin-arm64

# For Linux
npm install @rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu @swc/core-linux-x64-gnu lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu @tailwindcss/oxide-linux-x64-gnu
